Before I start I want to give a big shout-out to [Todd Ginsberg](https://github.com/tginsberg/advent-2024-kotlin) whose
solutions are very concise as well as idiomatic to read.
His repos are always very inspirational! I learned a lot from him.

Just use the main class and execute either the appropriate `solve` functions in the according `Day` classes or any `day`
function i.a.

**Enjoy!**
